TikzEdt needs Mono, Latex and the following LaTeX packages:
pgf, ms, xcolor, preview, mptopdf, circuitikz, pgfopts, pgfplots

On Ubuntu, you can install the basic prerequisites by running:

sudo apt-get install mono-complete
sudo apt-get install texlive
sudo apt-get install preview-latex-style


It is however recommended to replace the last two commands by 

sudo apt-get install texlive-full
