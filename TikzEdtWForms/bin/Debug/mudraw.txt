NAME
       mudraw - render PDF/XPS/CBZ documents

SYNOPSIS
       mudraw [options] input.{pdf,xps,cbz} [pages]

DESCRIPTION
       mudraw  will  render a document of a supported document format to image
       files.  The supported document formats are: pdf, xps and cbz.  The sup‐
       ported  image  formats are: pgm, ppm, pam and png.  Select the pages to
       be rendered by specifying a comma separated list of ranges and individ‐
       ual  page  numbers (for example: 1,5,10-15).  In no pages are specified
       all the pages will be rendered.

OPTIONS
       -o output
              The image format is deduced from the output file name.  Embed %d
              in   the   name  to  indicate  the  page  number  (for  example:
              "page%d.png").

       -p password
              Use the specified password if the file is encrypted.

       -r resolution
              Render the page at the specified resolution.  The default  reso‐
              lution is 72 dpi.

       -w width
              Render  the  page  at the specified width (or, if the -r flag is
              used, render with a maximum width).

       -h height
              Render the page at the specified height (or, if the -r  flag  is
              used, render with a maximum height).

       -f

       -R angle
              Rotate clockwise by given number of degrees.

       -a     Save  the alpha channel.  The default behavior is to render each
              page with a white background.  With this option, the page  back‐
              ground  is  transparent.   Only supported for pam and png output
              formats.

       -g     Render in grayscale.  The default is to render a full color  RGB
              image.   If  the  output  format  is  pgm  or ppm this option is
              ignored.

       -m     Show timing information.  Take the time it takes for  each  page
              to render and print a summary at the end.

       -5     Print an MD5 checksum of the rendered image data for each page.

       -t     Print  the  text  contents of each page in UTF-8 encoding.  Give
              the option twice to print detailed information about  the  loca‐
              tion of each character in XML format.

       -x     Print the display list used to render each page.

       -A     Disable the use of accelerated functions.

       -G gamma
              Gamma  correct the output image.  Some typical values are 0.7 or
              1.4 to thin or darken text rendering.

       -I     Invert the output image colors.

       pages  Comma separated list of ranges to render.
